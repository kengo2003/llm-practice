Strategic decision-making refers to crucial decisions that determine the long-term direction and competitiveness of an organization or company.
"Jūshin kōgeki" (縦深攻撃) translates to "deep battle" or "deep attack" in English. It's a military offensive strategy in ground combat that goes beyond merely engaging the enemy's front lines. The aim is to simultaneously attack deep into the enemy's defenses, targeting not only their forward units but also their rear-echelon elements such as reserve forces, artillery positions, command centers, and supply lines.
