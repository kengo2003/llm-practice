The primary objective of deep battle/attack is to paralyze and disorganize the entire enemy defense, thereby creating a breakthrough. This breakthrough is then exploited to encircle and annihilate the enemy forces.
This strategy is most effective when there's an overwhelming advantage in combat power: This means having a clear superiority over the enemy in terms of troops, firepower, and maneuverability. Breaking through multiple layers of enemy defenses and penetrating deep into their rear requires immense resources and capabilities.
It's also highly effective with ample long-range firepower and air support: To attack enemy rear units and supply lines, precise strike capabilities from long-range artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, and aircraft are essential. Sufficient fire support allows ground forces to advance smoothly.
